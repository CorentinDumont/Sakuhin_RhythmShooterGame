Developped entirely by Corentin Dumont.
Still under development.

Game developped with Unity version 5.3.1f1.
Repository contains this application built for OS X only, and the Assets folder of the game.
A folder containing all scripts is also put at the root, as it is the most valuable work.
The layout is not adapted to all screen resolution (ratio), so it may look ugly with some resolution, it will be corrected afterward.

Game's rules:

Choose your weapons in the Weapon's shop, and play. This is a mix between a Shooter game and a Rhythm game, when you perform well on the Rhythm game, your spaceship becomes stronger in the Shooter game. The challenge is to play two different games at the same time to survive and get stronger, until the boss appear...

Game's controls:

-Move the ship with the arrows.

-Tap on the "f","g" and "h" keys (respectively for the left, middle and right tiles) in rhythm with the beats of the music. 

-Tap on "p" to pause/unpause.

-Tap on "u"/"i" to decrease/increase the difficulty of the rythm game. (This will of course be done automatically in the final version)
